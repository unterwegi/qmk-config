# My QMK keyboard setup

This repo contains my own QMK keymap config for my Glorious GMMK 2 Compact Keyboard.

It follows a layout as described in this [Post@Medium](https://medium.com/@patrick.elmquist/separate-keymap-repo-for-qmk-136ff5a419bd)
to separate the main qmk_firmware repository from my own configuration.
